Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs as <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-mounts-and-vehicles.html\">mounts</a>, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well.</p>
