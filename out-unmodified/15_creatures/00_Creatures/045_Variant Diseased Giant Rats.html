<h4 id=\"variant-diseased-giant-rats\">Variant: Diseased Giant Rats</h4><p>Some giant rats carry vile <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-diseases.html\">diseases</a> that they spread with their bites. A <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-diseases.html\">disease</a>d giant rat has a challenge rating of 1/8 (25 XP) and the following action instead of its normal bite attack.</p><p><em><strong>Bite.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-diseases.html\">disease</a>. Until the <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-diseases.html\">disease</a> is cured, the target can’t regain hit points except by magical means, and the target’s hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the target’s hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-diseases.html\">disease</a>, the target dies.</p>
