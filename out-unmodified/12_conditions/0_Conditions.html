<h1 id=\"appendix-ph-a-conditions\">Appendix PH-A: Conditions</h1><p>Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html\">spell</a> , a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.</p><p>A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p><p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.</p><p>The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.</p><h4 id=\"blinded\">Blinded</h4><ul><li>A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li><li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.</li></ul><h4 id=\"charmed\">Charmed</h4><ul><li>A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li><li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</li></ul><h4 id=\"deafened\">Deafened</h4><ul><li>A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.</li></ul><h4 id=\"exhaustion\">Exhaustion</h4><p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.</p><table><thead><tr class=\"header\"><th>Level</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"odd\"><td>1</td><td>Disadvantage on ability checks</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>2</td><td>Speed halved</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>3</td><td>Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>4</td><td>Hit point maximum halved</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>5</td><td>Speed reduced to 0</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>6</td><td>Death</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.</p><p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p><p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p><p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</p><h4 id=\"frightened\">Frightened</h4><ul><li>A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</li><li>The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</li></ul><h4 id=\"grappled\">Grappled</h4><ul><li>A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</li><li>The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).</li><li>The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the <em>thunder-wave</em> spell.</li></ul><h4 id=\"incapacitated\">Incapacitated</h4><ul><li>An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.</li></ul><h4 id=\"invisible\">Invisible</h4><ul><li>An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.</li><li>Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.</li></ul><h4 id=\"paralyzed\">Paralyzed</h4><ul><li>A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.</li><li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li><li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li><li>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</li></ul><h4 id=\"petrified\">Petrified</h4><ul><li>A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone).
