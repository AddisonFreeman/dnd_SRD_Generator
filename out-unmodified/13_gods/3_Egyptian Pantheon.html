<h4 id=\"the-egyptian-pantheon\">The Egyptian Pantheon</h4><p>These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at—the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.</p><p>The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.</p><h5 id=\"egyptian-deities\">Egyptian Deities</h5><table><colgroup><col style=\"width: 39%\" /><col style=\"width: 8%\" /><col style=\"width: 20%\" /><col style=\"width: 30%\" /></colgroup><thead><tr class=\"header\"><th>Deity</th><th>Alignment</th><th>Suggested Domains</th><th>Symbol</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Re-Horakhty, god of the sun, ruler of the gods</td><td>LG</td><td>Life, Light</td><td>Solar disk encircled by serpent</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Anubis, god of judgment and death</td><td>LN</td><td>Death</td><td>Black jackal</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Apep, god of evil, fire, and serpents</td><td>NE</td><td>Trickery</td><td>Flaming snake</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Bast, goddess of cats and vengeance</td><td>CG</td><td>War</td><td>Cat</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Bes, god of luck and music</td><td>CN</td><td>Trickery</td><td>Image of the misshapen deity</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Hathor, goddess of love, music, and motherhood</td><td>NG</td><td>Life, Light</td><td>Horned cowʼs head with lunar disk</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Imhotep, god of crafts and medicine</td><td>NG</td><td>Knowledge</td><td>Step pyramid</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Isis, goddess of fertility and magic</td><td>NG</td><td>Knowledge, Life</td><td>Ankh and star</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Nephthys, goddess of death and grief</td><td>CG</td><td>Death</td><td>Horns around a lunar disk</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Osiris, god of nature and the underworld</td><td>LG</td><td>Life, Nature</td><td>Crook and flail</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Ptah, god of crafts, knowledge, and secrets</td><td>LN</td><td>Knowledge</td><td>Bull</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Set, god of darkness and desert storms</td><td>CE</td><td>Death, Tempest, Trickery</td><td>Coiled cobra</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Sobek, god of water and crocodiles</td><td>LE</td><td>Nature, Tempest</td><td>Crocodile head with horns and plumes</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Thoth, god of knowledge and wisdom</td><td>N</td><td>Knowledge</td><td>Ibis</td></tr></tbody></table>
