If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target’s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.</p><p><em><strong>Tail.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.</p><p><strong><em>Moan.</em></strong> Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker’s next turn.

If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.</p><p>Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can’t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.</p><p>A duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws.
