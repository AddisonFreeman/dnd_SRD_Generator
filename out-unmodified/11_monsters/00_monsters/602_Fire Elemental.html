	<strong>
		<em>Fire Form.</em>
	</strong>
	The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
</p><p>
	<strong>

	</strong>
	The elemental sheds bright light in a 30- foot radius and dim light in an additional 30 feet.
</p><p>
	<strong>
		<em>Water Susceptibility.</em>
	</strong>
	For every 5 feet the elemental moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.
