	<strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> 
	The dryad’s innate
	<a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-spellcasting.html">spellcasting</a>
	ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The dryad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
</p>
<p>
	At will:
	<em>druidcraft</em>
	3/day each:
	<em>entangle</em>
	,
	<em>goodberry</em>
	1/day each:
	<em>barkskin</em>
	,
	<em>pass without trace</em>
	,
	<em>shillelagh</em>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> 
	The dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		<em>Speak with Beasts and Plants.</em>
	</strong>
	The dryad can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		<em>Tree Stride.</em>
	</strong>
	Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of her
	<a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html">movement</a>
	to step magically into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or bigger.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Actions</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Club.</strong>
		Melee Weapon Attack:</em> 
	+2 to hit (+6 to hit with
	<em>shillelagh</em>
	), reach 5 ft., one target.
	<em>Hit:</em>
	2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage with
	<em>shillelagh</em>
	.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		<em>Fey Charm.</em>
	</strong>
	The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the dryad’s control, it takes the dryad’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.
</p>
<p>
	Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad’s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
	The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.
