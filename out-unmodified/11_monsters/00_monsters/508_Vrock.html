The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10)    <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-poisons.html\">poison</a>    damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.   </p><p>    <strong>     <em>Stunning Screech (1/Day).</em>    </strong>    The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the vrock's next turn.   </p>
