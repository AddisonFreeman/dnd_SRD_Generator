				<em>Magic Resistance.</em>
			</strong>
			The nalfeshnee has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
		</p><p>
			<strong>Actions</strong>
		</p><p>
			<strong>
				<em>Multiattack.</em>
			</strong>
			The nalfeshnee uses Horror Nimbus if it can. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
		</p><p>
			<em>
				<strong>Bite.</strong>
				Melee Weapon Attack:
			</em>
			+10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
			<em>Hit:</em>
			32 (5d10 + 5) piercing damage.
		</p><p>
			<em>
				<strong>Claw.</strong>
				Melee Weapon Attack:
			</em>
			+10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
			<em>Hit:</em>
			15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.
		</p><p>
			<strong>
				<em>Horror Nimbus (Recharge 5–6).</em>
			</strong>
			The nalfeshnee magically emits scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature within 15 feet of the nalfeshnee that can see the light must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the nalfeshnee’s Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.
		</p><p>
			<strong>
				<em>Teleport.</em>
			</strong>
			The nalfeshnee magically teleports, along with any

			it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
