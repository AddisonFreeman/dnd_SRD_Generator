		<em>Amphibious.</em>

	<strong>Actions</strong>
</p><p>
	<strong>
		<em>Multiattack.</em>
	</strong>
	The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
</p><p>
	<em>
		<strong>Bite.</strong>
		Melee Weapon Attack:
	</em>
	+11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
	<em>Hit:</em>
	17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage.
</p><p>
	<em>
		<strong>Claw.</strong>
		Melee Weapon Attack:
	</em>
	+11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
	<em>Hit:</em>
	13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.
</p><p>
	<em>
		<strong>Tail.</strong>
		Melee Weapon Attack:
	</em>
	+11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
	<em>Hit:</em>
	15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
</p><p>
	<strong>
		<em>Frightful Presence.</em>
	</strong>
	Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
</p><p>
	<strong>
		<em>Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6).</em>
	</strong>
	The dragon exhales acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
</p><p>
	<strong>Legendary Actions</strong>
</p><p>
	The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
</p><p>
	<strong>Detect.</strong>
	The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
</p><p>
	<strong>Tail Attack.</strong>
	The dragon makes a tail attack.
</p><p>
	<strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong>
	The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
