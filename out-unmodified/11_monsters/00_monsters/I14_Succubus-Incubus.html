Without wings, the fiend loses its flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form.

The charmed target obeys the fiend’s verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend’s Charm for the next 24 hours.</p><p>The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time.

The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p><p><strong><em>Etherealness.</em></strong> The fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.</p>
