			<em>
				<strong>Bite.</strong>
				Melee Weapon Attack:
			</em>
			+2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
			<em>Hit:</em>
			3 (1d6) piercing damage.
		</p><p>
			<em>
				<strong>Claws.</strong>
				Melee Weapon Attack:
			</em>
			+2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

		</p><p>
			<strong>
				<em>Fetid Cloud (1/Day).</em>
			</strong>
			A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can’t take reactions.
