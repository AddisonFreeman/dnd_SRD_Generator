		<em>Innate Spellcasting.</em>
	</strong>
	The hag’s innate
	<a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-spellcasting.html">spellcasting</a>
	ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
</p><p>
	At will:
	<em>detect magic</em>
	,
	<em>magic missile</em>
	2/day each:
	<em>plane shift</em>
	(self only),
	<em>ray of enfeeblement</em>
	,
	<em>sleep</em>
</p><p>
	<strong>
		<em>Magic Resistance.</em>
	</strong>
	The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
</p><p>
	<strong>
		<em>Actions</em>
	</strong>
</p><p>
	<em><strong>Claws (Hag Form Only).</strong>
		Melee Weapon Attack:</em> 
	+7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
	<em>Hit:</em>
	13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
</p><p>
	<strong>
		<em>Change Shape.</em>
	</strong>
	The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any
	<a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html">equipment</a>
	she is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.
</p><p>
	<strong>
		<em>Etherealness.</em>
	</strong>
	The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a
	<em>heartstone</em>
	in her possession.
</p><p>
	<strong>
		<em>Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).</em>
	</strong>
	While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A
	<em>protection from evil and good</em>
	spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a
	<em>magic circle</em>
	. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag’s
	<em>soul bag</em>
	. The reduction to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the
	<em>greater restoration</em>
	spell or similar magic.
