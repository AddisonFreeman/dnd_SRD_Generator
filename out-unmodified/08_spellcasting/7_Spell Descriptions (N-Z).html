The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.</p><h4 id=\"pass-without-trace\">Pass without Trace</h4><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.</p><h4 id=\"passwall\">Passwall</h4><p><em>5th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 hour</p><p>A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.</p><p>When the opening disappears, any creatures or <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a> still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.</p><h4 id=\"phantasmal-killer\">Phantasmal Killer</h4><p><em>4th-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.</p><h4 id=\"phantom-steed\">Phantom Steed</h4><p><em>3rd-level illusion (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 hour</p><p>A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a> created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.</p><p>For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.</p><h4 id=\"planar-ally\">Planar Ally</h4><p><em>6th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>10 minutes</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).</p><p>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.</p><p>Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-magic-items.html\">magic items</a> to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p><p>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p><p>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p><h4 id=\"planar-binding\">Planar Binding</h4><p><em>5th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 hour</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>24 hours</p><p>With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted<em>magic circle</em>in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.</p><p>A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th- level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.</p><h4 id=\"plane-shift\">Plane Shift</h4><p><em>7th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.</p><p>Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.</p><p>You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.</p><h4 id=\"plant-growth\">Plant Growth</h4><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action or 8 hours</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>150 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.</p><p>If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>for every 1 foot it moves.</p><p>You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected.</p><p>If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.</p><h4 id=\"polymorph\">Polymorph</h4><p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.</p><p>The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-ability-scores.html\">ability scores</a>, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-alignment.html\">alignment</a>and personality.</p><p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.</p><p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.</p><p>The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a>.</p><h4 id=\"power-word-kill\">Power Word Kill</h4><p><em>9th-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.</p><h4 id=\"power-word-stun\">Power Word Stun</h4><p><em>8th-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.</p><p>The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.</p><h4 id=\"prayer-of-healing\">Prayer of Healing</h4><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>10 minutes</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-spellcasting.html\">spellcasting</a>ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-damage-and-healing.html\">healing</a>increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><h4 id=\"prestidigitation\">Prestidigitation</h4><p><em>Transmutation cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>10 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Up to 1 hour</p><p>This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range: - You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. - You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. - You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot. - You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour. - You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour. - You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.</p><p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p><h4 id=\"prismatic-spray\">Prismatic Spray</h4><p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self (60-foot cone)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong><em>Red.</em></strong>The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li><li><strong><em>Orange.</em></strong>The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li><li><strong><em>Yellow.</em></strong>The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li><li><strong><em>Green.</em></strong>The target takes 10d6 <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-poisons.html\">poison</a> damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li><li><strong><em>Blue.</em></strong>The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li><li><strong><em>Indigo.</em></strong>On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</li><li><strong><em>Violet.</em></strong>On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)</li><li><strong><em>Special.</em></strong>The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.</li></ol><h4 id=\"prismatic-wall\">Prismatic Wall</h4><p><em>9th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>10 minutes</p><p>A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">position</a>the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.</p><p>The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.</p><p>The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.</p><p>The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A<em>rod of cancellation</em>destroys a<em>prismatic wall</em>, but an<em>antimagic field</em>has no effect on it.</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong><em>Red.</em></strong>The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.</li><li><strong><em>Orange.</em></strong>The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</li><li><strong><em>Yellow.</em></strong>The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.</li><li><strong><em>Green.</em></strong>The creature takes 10d6 <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-poisons.html\">poison</a> damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A<em>passwall</em>spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.</li><li><strong><em>Blue.</em></strong>The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</li><li><strong><em>Indigo.</em></strong>On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a<em>daylight</em>spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</li><li><strong><em>Violet.</em></strong>On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a<em>dispel magic</em>spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.</li></ol><h4 id=\"private-sanctum\">Private Sanctum</h4><p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>10 minutes</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>24 hours</p><p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties: - Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area. - The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it. - Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter. - Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells. - Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area. - Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html\">spell</a>slot of 5th level.</p><h4 id=\"produce-flame\">Produce Flame</h4><p><em>Conjuration cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>10 minutes</p><p>A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a>. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.</p><p>You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.</p><p>This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p><h4 id=\"programmed-illusion\">Programmed Illusion</h4><p><em>6th-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Until dispelled</p><p>You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.</p><p>When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.</p><p>The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-conditions.html\">conditions</a> that occur within 30 feet of the area.

The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.</p><p>You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn’t arrive.</p><h4 id=\"sequester\">Sequester</h4><p><em>7th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Until dispelled</p><p>By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.</p><p>If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.</p><p>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.

The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.</p><p>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-alignment.html\">alignment</a>and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.</p><p>You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</p><p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.</p><p>When you transform, you choose whether your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a> falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a> functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a>, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a> doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a> that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.</p><p>During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.</p><h4 id=\"shatter\">Shatter</h4><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a chip of mica)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range.

A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><h4 id=\"shield\">Shield</h4><p><em>1st-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the<em>magic missile</em>spell</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 round</p><p>An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you.

For the duration, you can use your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-spellcasting.html\">spellcasting</a>ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.</p><h4 id=\"shocking-grasp\">Shocking Grasp</h4><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-armor.html\">armor</a>made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p><p>The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p><h4 id=\"silence\">Silence</h4><p><em>2nd-level illusion (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html\">spell</a>that includes a verbal component is impossible there.</p><h4 id=\"silent-image\">Silent Image</h4><p><em>1st-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a bit of fleece)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.</p><p>You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.</p><h4 id=\"simulacrum\">Simulacrum</h4><p><em>7th-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>12 hours</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature’s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Until dispelled</p><p>You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a>. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.</p><p>The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-combat.html\">combat</a>. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.</p><p>If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.</p><p>If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.</p><h4 id=\"sleep\">Sleep</h4><p><em>1st-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>90 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 minute</p><p>This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).</p><p>Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.</p><p>Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p><h4 id=\"sleet-storm\">Sleet Storm</h4><p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>150 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.</p><p>The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.</p><p>If a creature is concentrating in the spell’s area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.</p><h4 id=\"slow\">Slow</h4><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a drop of molasses)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.</p><p>An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-magic-items.html\">magic items</a>, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p><p>If the creature attempts to cast a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html\">spell</a>with a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted.</p><p>A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.</p><h4 id=\"speak-with-animals\">Speak with Animals</h4><p><em>1st-level divination (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>10 minutes</p><p>You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM’s discretion.</p><h4 id=\"speak-with-dead\">Speak with Dead</h4><p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>10 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (burning incense)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>10 minutes</p><p>You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.</p><p>Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-languages.html\">languages</a>it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.</p><h4 id=\"speak-with-plants\">Speak with Plants</h4><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self (30-foot radius)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>10 minutes</p><p>You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.</p><p>You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.</p><p>Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.</p><p>If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.</p><p>This spell can cause the plants created by the<em>entangle</em>spell to release a restrained creature.</p><h4 id=\"spider-climb\">Spider Climb</h4><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.</p><h4 id=\"spike-growth\">Spike Growth</h4><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>150 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.</p><p>The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.</p><h4 id=\"spirit-guardians\">Spirit Guardians</h4><p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self (15-foot radius)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a holy symbol)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p><h4 id=\"spiritual-weapon\">Spiritual Weapon</h4><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 bonus action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 minute</p><p>You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-spellcasting.html\">spellcasting</a>ability modifier.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.</p><p>The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble that weapon.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.</p><h4 id=\"stinking-cloud\">Stinking Cloud</h4><p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>90 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.</p><p>Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-poisons.html\">poison</a> automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p><p>A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.</p><h4 id=\"stone-shape\">Stone Shape</h4><p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible.</p><h4 id=\"stoneskin\">Stoneskin</h4><p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p><h4 id=\"storm-of-vengeance\">Storm of Vengeance</h4><p><em>9th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Sight</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.</p><p>Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces additional effects on your turn.</p><p><strong><em>Round 2.</em></strong>Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.</p><p><strong><em>Round 3.</em></strong>You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a> of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong><em>Round 4.</em></strong>Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.</p><p><strong><em>Round 5–10.</em></strong>Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.</p><h4 id=\"suggestion\">Suggestion</h4><p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 8 hours</p><p>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.</p><p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p><p>You can also specify <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-conditions.html\">conditions</a> that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed.</p><p>If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.</p><h4 id=\"sunbeam\">Sunbeam</h4><p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self (60-foot line)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a magnifying glass)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.</p><p>For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.</p><p>This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html\">spell</a>.</p><h4 id=\"symbol\">Symbol</h4><p><em>7th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Until dispelled or triggered</p><p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p><p>The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.</p><p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p><p><strong><em>Death.</em></strong>Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p><strong><em>Discord.</em></strong>Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p><p><strong><em>Fear.</em></strong>Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.</p><p><strong><em>Hopelessness.</em></strong>Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.</p><p><strong><em>Insanity.</em></strong>Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish.

Make an ability check with your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-spellcasting.html\">spellcasting</a>ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong><em>On Target.</em></strong>You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong><em>Off Target.</em></strong>You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong><em>Similar Area.</em></strong>You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-wizard.html\">wizard</a>’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-tools.html\">tools</a>and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong><em>Mishap.</em></strong>The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p><h4 id=\"teleportation-circle\">Teleportation Circle</h4><p><em>5th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>10 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 round</p><p>As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p><p>Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.</p><p>You can create a permanent teleportation circle by <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>this spell in the same location every day for one year.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.</p><p>This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.</p><p><strong><em>Creature into Creature.</em></strong>If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating).

It retains its <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-alignment.html\">alignment</a>and personality.</p><p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.

The other side of the wall deals no damage.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p><h4 id=\"wall-of-force\">Wall of Force</h4><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).</p><p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall.

On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p>The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.</p><h4 id=\"wall-of-stone\">Wall of Stone</h4><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a small block of granite)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot- by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.</p><p>If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p><p>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p><p>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</p><p>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.</p><p>If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled.

You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p>A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p><h4 id=\"warding-bond\">Warding Bond</h4><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 hour</p><p>This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.</p><p>The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.</p><h4 id=\"water-breathing\">Water Breathing</h4><p><em>3rd-level transmutation (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>24 hours</p><p>This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-underwater-combat.html\">underwater</a>until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.</p><h4 id=\"water-walk\">Water Walk</h4><p><em>3rd-level transmutation (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a piece of cork)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 hour</p><p>This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.</p><p>If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.</p><h4 id=\"web\">Web</h4><p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20- foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.</p><p>If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.</p><p>Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a</p><p>Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.</p><p>A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.</p><p>The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p><h4 id=\"weird\">Weird</h4><p><em>9th-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to one minute</p><p>Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.</p><h4 id=\"wind-walk\">Wind Walk</h4><p><em>6th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (fire and holy water)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>8 hours</p><p>You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-weapons.html\">weapons</a>. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.</p><p>If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.</p><h4 id=\"wind-wall\">Wind Wall</h4><p><em>3rd-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a> can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.</p><h4 id=\"wish\">Wish</h4><p><em>9th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p><em>Wish</em>is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p><p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: - You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. - You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the<em>greater restoration</em>spell. - You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. - You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack. - You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a<em>wish</em>spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</p><p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-artifacts.html\">artifact</a> might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.</p><p>The stress of <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html\">spell</a>until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast<em>wish</em>ever again if you suffer this stress.</p><h4 id=\"word-of-recall\">Word of Recall</h4><p><em>6th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>5 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.</p><p>You must designate a sanctuary by <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.</p><h4 id=\"zone-of-truth\">Zone of Truth</h4><p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>10 minutes</p><p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.</p><p>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p>
