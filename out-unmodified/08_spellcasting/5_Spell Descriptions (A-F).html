Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><h4 id=\"acid-splash\">Acid Splash</h4><p><em>Conjuration cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.</p><p>This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p><h4 id=\"aid\">Aid</h4><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>8 hours</p><p>Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target’s hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target’s hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><h4 id=\"alarm\">Alarm</h4><p><em>1st-level abjuration (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>8 hours</p><p>You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.</p><p>A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.</p><p>An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.</p><h4 id=\"alter-self\">Alter Self</h4><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.</p><p><strong><em>Aquatic Adaptation.</em></strong>You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-underwater-combat.html\">underwater</a>and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p><strong><em>Change Appearance.</em></strong>You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.</p><p><strong><em>Natural Weapons.</em></strong>You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</p><h4 id=\"animal-messenger\">Animal Messenger</h4><p><em>2nd-level enchantment (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a morsel of food)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>24 hours</p><p>By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-dwarf.html\">dwarf</a>wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.</p><p>When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>If you cast this spell using a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html\">spell</a>slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.</p><h4 id=\"animal-shapes\">Animal Shapes</h4><p><em>8th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action<strong>Range:</strong>30 feet<strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 24 hours</p><p>Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.</p><p>The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-alignment.html\">alignment</a>and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.</p><p>The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a>.</p><h4 id=\"animate-dead\">Animate Dead</h4><p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>10 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).</p><p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p><p>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.</p><h4 id=\"animate-objects\">Animate Objects</h4><p><em>5th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a> within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a>, Large targets count as four <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a>, Huge targets count as eight <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a>. You can’t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p><h5 id=\"animated-object-statistics\">Animated Object Statistics</h5><table><thead><tr class=\"header\"><th>Size</th><th>HP</th><th>AC</th><th>Attack</th><th>Str</th><th>Dex</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Tiny</td><td>20</td><td>18</td><td>+8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage</td><td>4</td><td>18</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Small</td><td>25</td><td>16</td><td>+6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage</td><td>6</td><td>14</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Medium</td><td>40</td><td>13</td><td>+5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage</td><td>10</td><td>12</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Large</td><td>50</td><td>10</td><td>+6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage</td><td>14</td><td>10</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Huge</td><td>80</td><td>10</td><td>+8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage</td><td>18</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table><p>An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is</p><p>30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.</p><p>If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>If you cast this spell using a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html\">spell</a>slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a> for each slot level above 5th.</p><h4 id=\"antilife-shell\">Antilife Shell</h4><p><em>5th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self (10-foot radius)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10- foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.</p><p>The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-weapons.html\">weapons</a>through the barrier.</p><p>If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.</p><h4 id=\"antimagic-field\">Antimagic Field</h4><p><em>8th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self (10-foot-radius sphere)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-magic-items.html\">magic items</a> become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p><p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-artifacts.html\">artifact</a> or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p><p><strong><em>Targeted Effects.</em></strong>Spells and other magical effects, such as<em>magic missile</em>and<em>charm person</em>, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p><p><strong><em>Areas of Magic.</em></strong>The area of another spell or magical effect, such as<em>fireball</em>, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a<em>wall of fire</em>are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p><p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong>Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p><p><strong><em>Magic Items.</em></strong>The properties and powers of <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-magic-items.html\">magic items</a> are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a<em>+1 longsword</em>in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p><p>A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p><p><strong><em>Magical Travel.</em></strong>Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the<em>rope trick</em>spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p><p><strong><em>Creatures and Objects.</em></strong>A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p><p><strong><em>Dispel Magic.</em></strong>Spells and magical effects such as<em>dispel magic</em>have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different<em>antimagic field</em>spells don’t nullify each other.</p><h4 id=\"antipathysympathy\">Antipathy/Sympathy</h4><p><em>8th-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 hour</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the<em>antipathy</em>effect or a drop of honey for the<em>sympathy</em>effect)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>10 days</p><p>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.</p><p><strong><em>Antipathy.</em></strong>The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.</p><p><strong><em>Sympathy.</em></strong>The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the target.</p><p>If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.</p><p><strong><em>Ending the Effect.</em></strong>If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.</p><p>A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</p><h4 id=\"arcane-eye\">Arcane Eye</h4><p><em>4th-level divination</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.</p><p>You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.</p><p>As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.</p><h4 id=\"arcane-hand\">Arcane Hand</h4><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.</p><p>The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.</p><p>When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.</p><p><strong><em>Clenched Fist.</em></strong>The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.</p><p><strong><em>Forceful Hand.</em></strong>The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.</p><p>Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-spellcasting.html\">spellcasting</a>ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.</p><p><strong><em>Grasping Hand.</em></strong>The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-spellcasting.html\">spellcasting</a>ability modifier.</p><p><strong><em>Interposing Hand.</em></strong>The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p><h4 id=\"arcane-lock\">Arcane Lock</h4><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Until dispelled</p><p>You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting<em>knock</em>on the object suppresses<em>arcane lock</em>for 10 minutes.</p><p>While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.</p><h4 id=\"arcane-sword\">Arcane Sword</h4><p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.</p><p>When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.</p><h4 id=\"arcanists-magic-aura\">Arcanist’s Magic Aura</h4><p><em>2nd-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a small square of silk)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>24 hours</p><p>You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.</p><p>When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.</p><p><strong><em>False Aura.</em></strong>You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as<em>detect magic</em>, that detect magical auras<em>.</em>You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.</p><p><strong><em>Mask.</em></strong>You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-paladin.html\">paladin's</a>Divine Sense or the trigger of a<em>symbol</em>spell.

The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.</p><p>Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.</p><p>Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.</p><p>The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.</p><p>The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful<em>dispel magic</em>spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.</p><p>If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</p><h4 id=\"augury\">Augury</h4><p><em>2nd-level divination (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>By <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><p><strong><em>Whirlpool.</em></strong>This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep.

A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.</p><p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw.

A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.</p><p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p><h4 id=\"control-weather\">Control Weather</h4><p><em>8th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>10 minutes</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self (5-mile radius)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 8 hours</p><p>You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.

The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered.

When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p><p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.</p><h4 id=\"dimension-door\">Dimension Door</h4><p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>500 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as “200 feet straight downward” or “upward to the northwest at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet.”</p><p>You can bring along <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a> as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.</p><p>If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.</p><h4 id=\"disguise-self\">Disguise Self</h4><p><em>1st-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 hour</p><p>You make yourself—including your clothing, <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-armor.html\">armor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-weapons.html\">weapons</a>, and other belongings on your person— look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p><p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a> pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p><p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p><h4 id=\"disintegrate\">Disintegrate</h4><p><em>6th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by<em>wall of force.</em></p><p>A creature targeted by this spell must make a</p><p>Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage.

The creature can be restored to life only by means of a<em>true resurrection</em>or a<em>wish</em>spell.</p><p>This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot- cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p><h4 id=\"dispel-evil-and-good\">Dispel Evil and Good</h4><p><em>5th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</p><p>You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.</p><p><strong><em>Break Enchantment.</em></strong>As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.</p><p><strong><em>Dismissal.</em></strong>As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn’t there already).

Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-elf.html\">elves</a>, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.</p><p>If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html\">objects</a>, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.</p><p>You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p><p>If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</p><h4 id=\"earthquake\">Earthquake</h4><p><em>8th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>500 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.</p><p>The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.</p><p>Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.</p><p>When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p><p>This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.<strong><em>Fissures.</em></strong>Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.</p><p>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</p><p><strong><em>Structures.</em></strong>The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.</p><h4 id=\"enhance-ability\">Enhance Ability</h4><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour.</p><p>You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement.

Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.</p><p><strong><em>Enlarge.</em></strong>The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category— from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

While these <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-weapons.html\">weapons</a>are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.</p><p><strong><em>Reduce.</em></strong>The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-weapons.html\">weapons</a>also shrink to match its new size. While these <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-weapons.html\">weapons</a>are reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).</p><h4 id=\"entangle\">Entangle</h4><p><em>1st-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>90 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range.

Any creature that can’t be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you.

If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.</p><p>This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th.

If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p><p>If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.</p><p>If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.</p><h4 id=\"floating-disk\">Floating Disk</h4><p><em>1st-level conjuration (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a drop of mercury)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 hour</p><p>This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.</p><p>The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.</p><p>If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.</p><h4 id=\"fly\">Fly</h4><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.</p><h4 id=\"fog-cloud\">Fog Cloud</h4><p><em>1st-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.</p><h4 id=\"forbiddance\">Forbiddance</h4><p><em>6th-level abjuration (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>10 minutes</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 day</p><p>You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the<em>gate</em>spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the<em>plane shift</em>spell.</p><p>In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.</p><p>The spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of another<em>forbiddance</em>spell. If you cast<em>forbiddance</em>every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>.</p><h4 id=\"forcecage\">Forcecage</h4><p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>100 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 hour</p><p>An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.</p><p>A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.</p><p>A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.</p><p>When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.</p><p>A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.</p><p>This spell can’t be dispelled by<em>dispel magic</em>.</p><h4 id=\"foresight\">Foresight</h4><p><em>9th-level divination</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>8 hours</p><p>You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can’t be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.</p><p>This spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.</p><h4 id=\"freedom-of-movement\">Freedom of Movement</h4><p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 hour</p><p>You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.</p><p>The target can also spend 5 feet of <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-underwater-combat.html\">underwater</a>imposes no penalties on the target’s <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>or attacks.</p><h4 id=\"freezing-sphere\">Freezing Sphere</h4><p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>300 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Instantaneous</p><p>A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p><p>If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.</p><p>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a> of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
