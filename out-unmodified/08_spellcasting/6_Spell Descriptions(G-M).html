<h1>Spell Descriptions (G-M)</h1>
<h4 id=\"gaseous-form\">Gaseous Form</h4>
<p>
<em>3rd-level transmutation</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
1 action
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
Touch
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
Concentration, up to 1 hour
</p>
<p>
You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it’s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn’t affected.
</p>
<p>
While in this form, the target’s only method of
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>
is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.
</p>
<p>
While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast spells.
</p>
<h4 id=\"gate\">Gate</h4>
<p>
<em>9th-level conjuration</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
1 action
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
60 feet
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
Concentration, up to 1 minute
</p>
<p>
You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.
</p>
<p>
The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
</p>
<p>
Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.
</p>
<p>
When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.
</p>
<h4 id=\"geas\">Geas</h4>
<p>
<em>5th-level enchantment</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
1 minute
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
60 feet
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
30 days
</p>
<p>
You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.
</p>
<p>
You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.
</p>
<p>
You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A
<em>remove curse</em>
,
<em>greater restoration</em>
, or
<em>wish</em>
spell also ends it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>At Higher Levels.</em>
</strong>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.
</p>
<h4 id=\"gentle-repose\">Gentle Repose</h4>
<p>
<em>2nd-level necromancy (ritual)</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
1 action
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
Touch
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
10 days
</p>
<p>
You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.
</p>
<p>
The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as
<em>raise dead.</em>
</p>
<h4 id=\"giant-insect\">Giant Insect</h4>
<p>
<em>4th-level transmutation</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
1 action
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
30 feet
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
Concentration, up to 10 minutes
</p>
<p>
You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.
</p>
<p>
Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-combat.html\">combat</a>
, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.
</p>
<p>
A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.
</p>
<p>
The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.
</p>
<h4 id=\"glibness\">Glibness</h4>
<p>
<em>8th-level transmutation</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
1 action
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
Self
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
1 hour
</p>
<p>
Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.
</p>
<h4 id=\"globe-of-invulnerability\">Globe of Invulnerability</h4>
<p>
<em>6th-level abjuration</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
1 action
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
Self (10-foot radius)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
Concentration, up to 1 minute
</p>
<p>
An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.
</p>
<p>
Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html\">spell</a>
can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>At Higher Levels.</em>
</strong>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.
</p>
<h4 id=\"glyph-of-warding\">Glyph of Warding</h4>
<p>
<em>3rd-level abjuration</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
1 hour
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
Touch
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
Until dispelled or triggered
</p>
<p>
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
</p>
<p>
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
</p>
<p>
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
</p>
<p>
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-alignment.html\">alignment</a>
. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
</p>
<p>
When you inscribe the glyph, choose
<em>explosive runes</em>
or a
<em>spell glyph.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Explosive Runes.</em>
</strong>
When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Spell Glyph.</em>
</strong>
You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>
it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>At Higher Levels.</em>
</strong>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an
<em>explosive runes</em>
glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a
<em>spell glyph</em>
, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the
<em>glyph of warding.</em>
</p>

<strong>Duration:</strong>

</p>
<p>
Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.
</p>
<p>
When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
</p>

<em>6th-level abjuration</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
10 minutes
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
Touch
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
24 hours
</p>
<p>
You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>
the spell.
</p>
<p>
When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
</p>
<p>
<em>Guards and wards</em>
creates the following effects within the warded area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Corridors.</em>
</strong>
Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Doors.</em>
</strong>
All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an
<em>arcane lock</em>
spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the
<em>minor illusion</em>
spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Stairs.</em>
</strong>
Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the
<em>web</em>
spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while
<em>guards and wards</em>
lasts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Other Spell Effect.</em>
</strong>
You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold. - Place
<em>dancing lights</em>
in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as
<em>guards and wards</em>
lasts. - Place
<em>magic mouth</em>
in two locations. - Place
<em>stinking cloud</em>
in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while
<em>guards and wards</em>
lasts. - Place a constant
<em>gust of wind</em>
in one corridor or room. - Place a
<em>suggestion</em>
in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.
</p>
<p>
The whole warded area radiates magic. A
<em>dispel magic</em>
cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
</p>
<p>
You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>
this spell there every day for one year.

<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
Concentration, up to 1 minute
</p>
<p>
You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.
</p>
<h4 id=\"guiding-bolt\">Guiding Bolt</h4>

<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
1 round
</p>
<p>
A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>At Higher Levels.</em>
</strong>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S, M (a legume seed)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
Concentration, up to 1 minute
</p>
<p>
A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.
</p>
<p>
Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>
for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.
</p>
<p>
The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.
</p>
<p>
As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.
</p>
<h4 id=\"hallow\">Hallow</h4>
<p>
<em>5th-level evocation</em>

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a
<em>hallow</em>
spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.
</p>
<p>
First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.
</p>
<p>
Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Courage.</em>
</strong>
Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Darkness.</em>

Affected creatures can’t move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Fear.</em>
</strong>
Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.

Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures,
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a>
, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance.
</p>
<p>
The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took.

You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range.

While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target.
</p>
<p>
When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Burial.</em>
</strong>
The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.
</p>
<p>
The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Chaining.</em>
</strong>
Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then.
</p>
<p>
The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Hedged Prison.</em>
</strong>
The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.
</p>
<p>
The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Minimus Containment.</em>
</strong>
The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.
</p>
<p>
The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Slumber.</em>
</strong>
The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	<em>Ending the Spell.</em>
</strong>
During the
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a>
of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.
</p>
<p>
A
<em>dispel magic</em>
spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.
</p>
<p>
You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first

Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn’t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.
</p>
<p>
The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word
<em>Rudnogg</em>
on the lips.”

One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range.

You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.
</p>
<p>
Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways: - The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. - The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder. - Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.

V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
Until dispelled
</p>
<p>
Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.
</p>
<p>
You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a
<em>protection from evil and good</em>
or
<em>magic circle</em>
spell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-alignment.html\">alignment</a>
and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.
</p>
<p>
While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-spellcasting.html\">spellcasting</a>
DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.
</p>
<p>
If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
</p>
<p>When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.</p>

<p>
You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
</p>
<p>
When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.
</p>
<p>
The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

<p>
You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
</p>
<p>
You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-human.html\">human</a>

Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

<strong>Duration:</strong>

</p>
<p>
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).
</p>
<p>
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
</p>
<p>
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability.

</p>
<p>
The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).
</p>
<p>
When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

<strong>Components:</strong>
V, S
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>

</p>
<p>
You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a>
you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.
</p>
<p>
While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>
to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can’t move.
</p>
<p>
Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.
</p>
<p>
This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
</p>
<p>
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.
</p>
<p>
The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

<em>Illusion cantrip</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Casting Time:</strong>
1 action
</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
30 feet
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components:</strong>
S, M (a bit of fleece)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
1 minute
</p>
<p>
You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
</p>
<p>
If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
</p>
<p>
If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
</p>
<p>
If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

<strong>Duration:</strong>

</p>
<p>
You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain’s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
</p>
<p>
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a>
through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.
</p>
<p>
Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">position</a>
so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
</p>
<p>
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
</p>
<p>
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
</p>
<p>
A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
</p>
<p>
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.
</p>
<p>
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

<p>
You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.
</p>
<p>
While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.
</p>
<p>
You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.
</p>
<p>
A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations,
<a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-alignment.html\">alignment</a>, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.
</p>
<p>
A
<em>remove curse</em>
or
<em>greater restoration</em>
spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.

<p>
A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot- radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
</p>
<p>
When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
</p>
<p>
A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light.
</p>
<p>
On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

<strong>Casting Time:</strong>

<strong>Components:</strong>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration:</strong>
Concentration, up to 2 hours
</p>
<p>
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.
</p>
<p>
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.
</p>
<p>
Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.
</p>
<p>
This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.
</p>
