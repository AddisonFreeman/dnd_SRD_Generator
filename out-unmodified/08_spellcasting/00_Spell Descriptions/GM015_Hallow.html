The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a<em>hallow</em>spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.</p><p>First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> charm, frighten, or possess <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> from this effect.</p><p>Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a>, <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> that follow a specific deity or leader, or <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.</p><p><strong><em>Courage.</em></strong>Affected <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> can’t be frightened while in the area.</p><p><strong><em>Darkness.</em></strong>Darkness fills the area.
