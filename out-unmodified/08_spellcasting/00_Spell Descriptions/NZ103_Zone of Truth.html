<h4 id=\"zone-of-truth\">Zone of Truth</h4><p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>10 minutes</p><p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.</p><p>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p>
