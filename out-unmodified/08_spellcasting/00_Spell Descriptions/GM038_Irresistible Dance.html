The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that canâ€™t be charmed are immune to this spell.</p><p>A dancing creature must use all its <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-movement-and-position.html\">movement</a> to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html\">creatures</a> have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.</p>
