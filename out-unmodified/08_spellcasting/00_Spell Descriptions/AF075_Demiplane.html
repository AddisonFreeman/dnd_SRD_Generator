<h4 id="demiplane">Demiplane</h4><p><em>8th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>1 hour</p><p>You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> or <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html">objects</a> inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.</p><p>Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html">casting</a> of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html">casting</a> of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.</p>
