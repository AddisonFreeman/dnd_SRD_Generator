All <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> and <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html">objects</a> that arenâ€™t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.</p><p>If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html">objects</a> and <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.</p><p>At the end of the duration, affected <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-objects.html">objects</a> and <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html">creatures</a> fall back down.</p>
