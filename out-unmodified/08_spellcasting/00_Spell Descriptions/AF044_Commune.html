You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.</p><p>Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.</p><p>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-casting-a-spell.html\">casting</a> after the first that you get no answer.
