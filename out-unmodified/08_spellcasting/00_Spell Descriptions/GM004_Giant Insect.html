<h4 id=\"giant-insect\">Giant Insect</h4><p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.</p><p>Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-combat.html\">combat</a>, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html\">creatures</a> and resolves their actions and movement.</p><p>A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.</p><p>The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.</p>
