Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a<em>contingency</em>cast with<em>water breathing</em>might stipulate that<em>water breathing</em>comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then<em>contingency</em>ends.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one<em>contingency</em>spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another<em>contingency</em>spell on you ends. Also,<em>contingency</em>ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p>
