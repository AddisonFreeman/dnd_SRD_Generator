<h4 id=\"hallucinatory-terrain\">Hallucinatory Terrain</h4><p><em>4th-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>10 minutes</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>300 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>24 hours</p><p>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-equipment.html\">equipment</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html\">creatures</a> within the area aren’t changed in appearance.</p><p>The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so <a href=\"https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-creatures.html\">creatures</a> entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.</p>
