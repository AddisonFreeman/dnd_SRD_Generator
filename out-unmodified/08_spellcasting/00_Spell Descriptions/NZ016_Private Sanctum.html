<h4 id="private-sanctum">Private Sanctum</h4><p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong>10 minutes</p><p><strong>Range:</strong>120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong>V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong>24 hours</p><p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties: - Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area. - The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it. - Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter. - Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells. - Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area. - Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a <a href="https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/pages/dnd5e-what-is-a-spell.html">spell</a> slot of 5th level.</p>
